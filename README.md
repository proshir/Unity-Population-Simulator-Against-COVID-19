## Description:

Welcome to the Unity Population Simulator Against COVID-19, a fascinating project that utilizes the power of Unity to simulate the spread of the COVID-19 virus within a population of 500 individuals living on a virtual island. This project aims to provide insights into how changes in human behavior, such as staying at home or venturing outside, impact the spread of the virus and the resulting health outcomes.

## Key Features:

Population Simulation: The heart of this project is a realistic population simulator that places 500 virtual inhabitants on an island. These individuals move, interact, and simulate daily life activities.

COVID-19 Spread: Watch as the COVID-19 virus spreads within the population. Each individual can become infected, and the simulation tracks the progression of the virus, including recovery and unfortunately, mortality rates.

Behavioral Experiments: Change the parameters of the simulation to experiment with how different behaviors affect the virus's spread. You can adjust the number of people leaving their homes each day, creating scenarios that mimic lockdowns, reopenings, or other public health interventions.

Data Visualization: Observe and analyze data in real-time as the simulation progresses. Charts and statistics provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the virus within the population.

Educational Value: This project serves as a powerful educational tool, helping users understand the complexities of infectious disease transmission and the importance of public health measures.

## How to Use:

Download the Unity Population Simulator Against COVID-19 project from this GitHub repository.

Open the project in Unity and explore the simulation parameters.

Run the simulation and observe how changes in human behavior impact the spread of COVID-19 within the population.

Analyze the data generated by the simulation to draw conclusions and insights.
